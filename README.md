📌 Project Title

Credit Card Fraud Detection

📖 Problem Statement

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning to minimize financial losses caused by fraud.

📊 Dataset

Real-world credit card transaction dataset

Highly imbalanced (fraud << normal transactions)

🛠️ Approach

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Handled class imbalance using SMOTE

Trained classification models

Evaluated performance using ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

📈 Results

Achieved strong fraud detection performance

ROC-AUC and F1-score used to validate robustness

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib

🚀 Future Improvements

Try ensemble models

Deploy as a REST API

Real-time fraud detection pipeline
